    <h2>History of the Saxophone</h2>
    <p>
      The saxophone was invented in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker. Originally intended for orchestras and military bands, it quickly gained popularity in jazz, classical, and popular music for its expressive sound and versatility. Its metallic body and single-reed mouthpiece set it apart from other woodwinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the 20th century, the saxophone became a central instrument in jazz, shaping the genre’s sound. Legendary saxophonists like Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Sonny Rollins contributed to its iconic status. Today, saxophones are featured in diverse musical styles and ensembles worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, the saxophone family includes a range from the tiny sopranino to the gigantic subcontrabass, each with unique tonal qualities. Although not always present in classical orchestras, the saxophone is vital in wind bands, jazz, rock, and even experimental music.
